module test/coq-semantics/similarly_named_constructors

signature

  // SDF-generated A-Terms are distinguished by their arity.
  // Coq does not make such distinctions.
  // Thus, unless we rename constructors in Coq, the following SDF terms would result in a Coq type that does not type-check:

  sorts X constructors
    x : X
    x : X -> X
